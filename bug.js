This error occurs when using the Expo `Camera` API and attempting to access the camera's preview before it's fully initialized.  It's often masked by other errors and difficult to debug. The core problem is a race condition where the app tries to use the camera before the Expo Camera component has finished setting up. This results in undefined behavior, often manifesting as unexpected crashes or silent failures.
